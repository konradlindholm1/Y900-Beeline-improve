               <h3>Certification</h3>
<div class="padd">The data from the declarations of conformity are indicated in the certification card supplied.<br>
<strong>Compliance with the WEEE Directive</strong><br>
This device complies with the essential requirements and other substantive provisions of the Directive on the disposal of waste for electrical and electronic equipment 2002/96/EU (WEEE).<br>
<strong>Compliance with the RoHs Directive</strong><br>
This device complies with the 2002/95/EU Directive, which restricts the amount of certain hazardous substances contained in electrical and electronic equipment (RoHs Directives).<br>
<strong>Electromagnetic radiation</strong><br>
A guarantee of compliance with the international standards (ICNIRP) and the European Directive 1999/5/EU (R&TTE) is a mandatory condition for market release of any mobile device model. The main requirement of these standards and guidelines is to protect the health and safety of consumers and the people around them.<br>
THIS PRODUCT IS IN CONFORMITY WITH INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS GOVERNING THE LIMITS ON THE EFFECTS OF RADIO WAVES ON PEOPLE.<br>
This mobile device is a transmitter and receiver of the radio signal. Its design prevents the device from exceeding the critical levels of exposure to radio waves (radio frequency electromagnetic fields), established by international guidelines. The standards were developed by the independent research organization (ICNIRP) in order to ensure the safety of all persons, regardless of age and health. The standards that define the acceptable level of exposure to radio waves utilize the term referred to as the specific absorption rate of electromagnetic energy (Specific Absorption Rate, or SAR). Mobile devices have a SAR limit of 2 W/kg. Tests for SAR measurement are conducted for standard working positions of the device, in which the radiation level of the device is at the highest certified level in all operating frequency bands.</div>

              </table>
              <div class="padd">During use, the actual SAR value for the device is generally significantly lower than its maximum values. This is due to the fact that the device automatically selects the minimum power level adequate for a reliable network connection. The lower the power of the output device, the lower the SAR value.</div>
<div class="padd">Measurement of the SAR value while wearing a device on the body was conducted at a distance of 5 mm from the body. To ensure the required level of SAR, the device must be located at least 5 mm from your body.</div>
<div class="padd">If you use accessories that were not approved by the manufacturer, please make sure that they do not contain metal components and that they ensure the positioning of the device at the specified distance from the body.</div>
